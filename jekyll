jekyll install page:

- https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

Installed ruby with:
sudo apt-get install ruby2.0

I than got rubygems with:

sudo apt-get install rubygems


I than tried to gem install jekyll.

I got this error message:
"ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension."

This link had me apt-get ruby-dev

After installing 'make' and a long wait, I was told I needed a version of ruby equal to or greater than two.

But I installed 2?

This seems to be a common problem.

Back to 'failed to build gem native extension'

This page told me to install ruby2.0-dev to fix my problems

Now everything works.
